# Responsive Tribute Page: Showcasing HTML & CSS Fundamentals - **The Foundation You Can Build On**

This project is a meticulously crafted **responsive tribute page** dedicated to a notable subject (Rosa Parks), built to showcase information in a structured and respectful manner. It serves as a clear demonstration of my proficiency in fundamental web technologies, proving my ability to lay a solid groundwork for any digital presence:

* **Semantic HTML5 Mastery:** Utilizing appropriate tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`) to create a clear, accessible, and well-organized document structure. This ensures your content is understood by both users and search engines, laying the groundwork for robust **information architecture**.
* **CSS3 Styling & Layout Expertise:** Applying advanced CSS techniques for stunning visual presentation, including typography, adaptive color management, and dynamic layout systems. My approach ensures not just beauty, but **cross-browser consistency** and **optimal user experience**.
* **Responsive Web Design Proficiency:** Guaranteeing an optimal viewing experience and seamless adaptability across **all screen sizes** (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices) through flexible layouts and media queries. This is critical for maximizing reach and engagement in today's multi-device world.
* **Image Handling & Optimization:** Implementing best practices for displaying and captioning images within a responsive context, ensuring fast load times and visual integrity.
* **Accessibility Foundations:** Building with a conscious consideration for readability, navigability, and inclusivity, making your digital content accessible to a broader audience.
