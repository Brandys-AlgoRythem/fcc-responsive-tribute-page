# Responsive Tribute Page: Showcasing HTML & CSS Fundamentals

This project is a meticulously crafted **responsive tribute page** dedicated to a notable subject (Rosa Parks), built to showcase information in a structured and respectful manner. It serves as a clear demonstration of my proficiency in fundamental web technologies, specifically:

* **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizing appropriate tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`) to create a clear, accessible, and well-organized document structure.
* **CSS3 Styling & Layout:** Applying advanced CSS techniques for visual presentation, including typography, color management, box model control, and visually appealing layouts.
* **Responsive Web Design:** Ensuring an optimal viewing experience and seamless adaptability across various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices) through flexible layouts and media queries.
* **Image Handling:** Implementing best practices for displaying and captioning images within a responsive context.
* **Accessibility Foundations:** Building with consideration for readability and navigability.
